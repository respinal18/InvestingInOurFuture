<h2 align="left">Overview</h2>
<p align="left">This project investigates whether a country‚Äôs health and education outcomes improve based on government spending in these sectors. The analysis focuses on two neighboring countries, the United States and Canada, with differing approaches to funding health and education. The study examines spending trends and their associated outcomes over a decade (2004-2013).</p>

<h2 align="left">Key Question</h2>
<p align="left">Does more government spending on health and education lead to better outcomes in these areas?</p>
<h3 align="left"><b>Hypothesis:</b></h3>
<p align="left">The United States, with its higher spending, was hypothesized to have better health and education outcomes than Canada.</p>

<h2 align="left">Methodology</h2>

<ol align="left">
  <li><b>Data Collection:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Health and education spending per capita and as a percentage of government budgets for both countries.</li>
      <li>Health indicators: life expectancy, infant mortality rate, immunization rates, and incidences of TB/HIV.</li>
      <li>Education indicators: youth not in education, employment, or training (NEET) rates and unemployment rates by education level.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Comparison:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Spending trends were compared, accounting for factors such as recessions.</li>
      <li>Outcomes were analyzed to evaluate correlations with spending levels.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Languages and Tools Used</h2>

<p><b> üõ† Excel </b> for data cleaning, transforming and preparing data for analysis.</p>
<p><b> üöÄ SQL </b> extracted specific parts of the dataset, filtered necessary data, explored relationships between variables, handled incomplete data, and organized the data for deeper insights.</p>
<p><b> üìΩÔ∏è PowerPoint </b> for designing a visually engaging presentation to communicate insights effectively.</p>

<h2>Key Findings</h2>

<ol>
  <li><b>Health:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>The USA consistently spent more per capita on health than Canada and allocated a higher percentage of its government budget (18-21% vs. Canada‚Äôs 17-18%).</li>
      <li>Despite higher spending, health outcomes were not proportionally better.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Education:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Initially, the USA spent more per capita on education, but after 2007, Canada‚Äôs spending surpassed the USA.</li>
      <li>Both countries experienced spending declines during the 2008-2009 recession.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Contrary to the hypothesis, higher spending did not guarantee better outcomes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Canada, despite lower spending in certain periods, consistently achieved better health and education outcomes.</li>
  <li>Factors beyond spending, such as universal healthcare in Canada, cultural norms, individual behaviors, and economic conditions, play critical roles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>

<ol>
  <li>For the USA: Explore models like Canada‚Äôs universal healthcare system and focus on reducing huge gaps in educational attainment and health services.</li>
  <li>For Both Countries: Develop data-driven policies to target areas of underperformance and regularly evaluate spending efficiency.</li>
</ol>

<p>By prioritizing informed strategies (based on data), governments can enhance societal well-being and promote sustainable development.</p>
